# Azure KeyVault

In order to use KeyVault, you need to do several things. I will list them up for you here:

# Create an "App registration" under ActiveDirectory

1. Search for "Active Directory" in Azure
2. Go to the tab "App registrations"
3. Register a new app (+ new application registration)
4. Give it a name (stellafiestaapikode), an application type (Web app /Api), and a random direct url.
5. When you have created it, you can retrieve its "Application id", e.g. "a5e2800d-7da6-4f7c-b3d6-7cc53bdf532x", which will be used as your clientId later.
